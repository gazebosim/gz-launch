    /// # Websocket Server Interface
    ///
    /// The websocket server listens for incoming requests and sends
    /// messages based on the requests.
    ///
    /// All messages on the websocket, incoming and outgoing, are structured
    /// in a frame that consists of four comma separated components:
    ///     1. `operation`: string,
    ///     2. `topic_name`: string,
    ///     3. `message_type`: string, and
    ///     4. `payload`: serialized data.
    ///
    /// The `operation` component is mandatory and must be one of:
    ///     1. "sub": Subscribe to the topic in the `topic_name` component,
    ///     2. "pub": Publish a message from the Ignition Transport topic in
    ///               the `topic_name` component,
    ///     3. "topics": Get the list of available topics,
    ///     4. "topics-types": Get the list of available topics and their
    ///                        message types,
    ///     5. "protos": Get a string containing all the protobuf
    ///                  definitions, and
    ///     6. "particle_emitters": Get the list of particle emitters.
    ///                  definitions.
    ///     7. "unsub": Unsubscribe from the topic in the `topic_name` component
    ///
    /// The `topic_name` component is mandatory for the "sub", "pub", and
    /// "unsub" operations. If present, it must be the name of an Ignition
    /// Transport topic.
    ///
    /// The `message_type` component is mandatory for the "pub" operation. If
    /// present it names the Ignition Message type, such as
    /// "ignition.msgs.Clock".
    ///
    /// The `payload` component is mandatory for the "pub" operation. If
    /// present, it contains a serialized string of an Ignition Message.
    ///
    /// ## Example frames
    ///
    /// 1. Get the list of topics: `topics,,,`
    ///
    /// 2. Get the protobuf definitions: `protos,,,`
    ///
    /// 3. Subscribe to the "/clock" topic: `sub,/clock,,`
    ///
    /// 4. Websocket server publishing data on the "/clock" topic:
    ///    `pub,/clock,ignition.msgs.Clock,<serialized_data>`
    ///
    /// # Example usage
    ///
    /// ## Websocket Server
    ///
    /// 1. Define a launch file by copying the following contents to a file
    ///    called `websocket.ign`.

    ///    <publication_hz>30</publication_hz>
    /// </plugin>

    /// 2. Run the launch file

    /// `ign launch -v 4 websocket.ign`
