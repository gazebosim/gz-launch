# Install

These instructions are for installing only Gazebo Launch. If you're interested
in using all the Gazebo libraries, not only Gazebo Launch, check out this
[Gazebo installation](https://gazebosim.org/docs/latest/install).

We recommend following the binary install instructions to get up and running as
quickly and painlessly as possible.

The source install instructions should be used if you need the very latest
software improvements, if you need to modify the code, or if you plan to make a
contribution.

# Binary Install

We recommend following the [Binary Install](#binary-install) instructions to get up and running as quickly and painlessly as possible.

The [Source Install](#source-install) instructions should be used if you need the very latest software improvements, you need to modify the code, or you plan to make a contribution.

## Ubuntu 20.04 or above

On Ubuntu systems, `apt` can be used to install `gz-launch`:

```
sudo apt install libgz-launch<#>
```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 6 or 7, depending on
which version you need.

## macOS

On macOS, add OSRF packages:
  ```
  ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  brew tap osrf/simulation
  ```

Install Gazebo GUI:
  ```
  brew install gz-launch<#>
  ```

Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 4 or 5, depending on
which version you need.

1. Install third-party libraries:

    ```sh
    sudo apt -y install \
      $(sort -u $(find . -iname 'packages-'`lsb_release -cs`'.apt' -o -iname 'packages.apt' | grep -v '/\.git/') | sed '/gz\|sdf/d' | tr '\n' ' ')
    ```

1. Install required Gazebo libraries

    ```sh
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
    wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install libgz-cmake4-dev libgz-sim10-dev
    ```

### Building from source

1. Clone the repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-launch
    ```

2. Configure and build

    ```sh
    cd gz-launch; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
    ```

3. Optionally, install Gazebo Launch

    ```sh
    sudo make install
    ```

## macOS

1. Clone the repository

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-launch -b gz-launch<#>
  ```

  Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 4 or 5, depending on
  which version you need.

2. Install dependencies

  ```sh
  brew install --only-dependencies gz-launch<#>
  ```

  Be sure to replace `<#>` with a number value, such as 5 or 6, depending on
  which version you need.

3. Configure and build
